TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF :
--------------------------
So good afternoon [Rehman and Surya if i am not wrong], i would like to thank you BOTH for this wonderful opportunity.
I am Dileep and I have a Bachelor's degree in computer science from SRKR Andhra university.  I belong to vizianagaram  but i stay in hyderabad.
I have a 4+ years of hands-on software development experience from TCS Hyderabad.
As part of my experience I have Experience with supporting mission critical systems. I have worked on 2 projects Moshell and E2C.

	1. Coming to moshell, it belongs to a swedish company ERICSSON and is a tool to connect to various network elements belonging to all generations 2g,3g,4g and now 5g as well.
	   It is a command line application, so I worked as a linux developer for over 2 years and as part of my roles, I have developed multiple scripts using linux shell scripting and bash and a bit of python.
	   We use git and gerrit extensively for the contineous integration of our code.

    2. Coming to E2C, it belongs to the same company Ericsson which is in a process of migrating most of its applications from on-prem to AWS cloud.
	   So I worked as a solutions architect for more than 1 and half a year now and involved in architectural discussions.
	   Aws is a speghatti bowl and have more than 180 resources . It is a point of time that i had a complete turn from development to architecture .
	   As a part of the job, I took my CCP (aws certified cloud practioner j) certification and achieved a total of 986/1000 which is a pretty much decent score.

	   So as part of AWS :
	   a. I have performed some of the operations such as updating the AMI's to upgraded versions or sometimes to a bit downgraded versions and perform autoscaling and load balancing using target groups.
	   b. Configure VPC with required security groups and NACL's and Igw', knowledge on classful, class less CIDR ranges , subnets, subnet mask, VPN.
	   c. Sometimes perform sql queries on AWS ATHENA on various logs and report the results.
	   d. Create peering connections,configure flow logs, create IAM users, roles and train other colleagues.
	   e. Use S3 for data archiving and backup, apply data cycle policies etc;
	   f. I also have experience on varius encryption techniques (symmetric and asymetric) , how to manage CMK's and the generated data keys and signing certificates .
       g. configure sns topics and add subscribers , build sample serverless applications.

    3. Right now I am  planning to migrate one of our teams website to cloud into a serverless architecture which I can demonstarte if we have time.

I belong to a nuclear family, I am self motivated and hardworking. To mention about my hobbies, I would love to play cricket and do some paintings.
So to summerize, I am quite good in most of the AWS services, linux scripting, git,basics of  python and SQL as well.
I am now currently in a process to learn other devops tools such as DOCKER, Kubernetis and planning to have my next certification in the coming week for SSA.
I understand that for this position of cloud engineer that you are looking for, I am confident I will be able to succeed and be able to perform my responsibilities.

NEGOTIATE WITH HR : // ONLY ON THURSDAY EVENING OR FRIDAY !!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. location
2. remote or in office ?
3. hike cycle
4. take home salary ? variable pay?
5. Your package = Fixed Pay(X% of total package) + Variable pay(100-X% of total package).
   So Variable pay is the part of your salary package .
   you will get your fixed pay at the end of every month but you will get your variable pay once in a quarter/half year/year(may differ from company to company).

 a. do not show greediness or enthusiasm
 b. negotiable ?
 c. mention percentage like 50% or 70%  hike not a figure like 55000 or 700000
 d. I usually outperform my colleagues in the previous company hopefuly I will do it here as well. So i think this can be an investiment on me.

 I donot doubt that ABC will offer me a competitive salary within the industry standards.
 Since i am a fresher, i am looking forward to getting started with building my career.
 I am passionate about the cloud field and i know that ABC will give me an opprtuninty to get hands-0n experience.
 For me being a part of the team and learning is equally important.
 while interacting with the interviewers today hopefuly i got to know more about the training, dev and experience about working in this company.
 I am sure we can come to an agreement on the salary.

 Based on my 4 year experience in the software field and the info provided on the glassdoor, i believe a salary in the range of rs.x to rs.y would do justice.

 BUDGET : I understand that this is your budget, but i think this is my value and deservingly so. It would be great if you can match up to it.
 and then we can always come to a point where we both are comfortable.
