AWS CLOUD FRONT :
---------------
Amazon Cloud Front is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users.
Cloud Front delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centres called edge locations.
When a user requests content that you're serving with  , the request is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.
  •If the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency, CloudFront delivers it immediately.
  •If the content is not in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an origin that you've defined—such as an Amazon S3 bucket, a Media Package channel,
You also get increased reliability and availability because copies of your files (also known as objects) are now held (or cached) in multiple edge locations around the world.
Keeps your objects in CloudFront edge locations for the default duration of 24 hours (the minimum duration is 0 seconds)
    •Accelerate static website content delivery
    •Serve video on demand or live streaming video
    •Encrypt specific fields throughout system processing
    •Customize at the edge

Way of Working :
--------------------
1. You specify origin servers, like an Amazon S3 bucket or your own HTTP server, from which CloudFront gets your files which will then be distributed from CloudFront edge locations all over the world.
   The origin server can be an S3 if you are serving content over HTTP such as a webserver .
2.You upload your files to your origin servers. Your files, also known as objects, typically include webpages, images, and media files .
   If you're using an Amazon S3 bucket as an origin server, you can make the objects in your bucket publicly readable, so that anyone who knows the CloudFront URLs for your objects can access them.
3. You create a CloudFront distribution, which tells CloudFront which origin servers to get your files from when users request the files through your web site or application.
4. CloudFront assigns a domain name to your new distribution that you can see in the CloudFront console, or that is returned in the response to a programmatic request
5. CloudFront sends your distribution's configuration (but not your content) to all of its edge locations or points of presence (POPs)— collections of servers in geographically-dispersed data centres where CloudFront caches copies of your files.

  --> Say you have an object with a domain name http://www.example.com/logo.jpg.
  --> Cloud Front assigns a domain name for the distribution say http://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/logo.jpg.
  --> You can use domain from cloudfront or you can set up CloudFront to use your own domain name with your distribution.
  --> Optionally, you can configure your origin server to add headers to the files, to indicate how long you want the files to stay in the cache in CloudFront edge locations.

                                      V
                              Regional Edge cache

  --> Initially there used to be only POP's where data is cached . But now there are also Regional edge caches .
  --> Regional edge caches are CloudFront locations that are deployed globally, close to your viewers.
  --> They're located between your origin server and the POPs—global edge locations that serve content directly to viewers.
  --> As objects become less popular, individual POPs might remove those objects to make room for more popular content.
  --> Regional edge caches have a larger cache than an individual POP, so objects remain in the cache longer at the nearest regional edge cache location.
  --> This helps keep more of your content closer to your viewers, reducing the need for CloudFront to go back to your origin server
  *** So if POP does not have some content , instead of going to ORIGIN SERVER , it first checks the REGIONAL EDGE CACHE .


LAMBDA@EGDE :
-------------------
Lambda@Edge is an extension of AWS Lambda, a compute service that lets you execute functions that customize the content that CloudFront delivers.
You can author Node.js or Python functions in one Region, US-East-1 (N. Virginia), and then execute them in AWS locations globally that are closer to the viewer, without provisioning or managing servers.
Lambda@Edge scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.
Processing requests at AWS locations closer to the viewer instead of on origin servers significantly reduces latency and improves the user experience.

 You can execute Lambda functions when the following CloudFront events occur:
    •When CloudFront receives a request from a viewer (viewer request)
    •Before CloudFront forwards a request to the origin (origin request)
    •When CloudFront receives a response from the origin (origin response)
    •Before CloudFront returns the response to the viewer (viewer response)

There are many uses for Lambda@Edge processing. For example:
    •A Lambda function can inspect cookies and rewrite URLs so that users see different versions of a site for A/B testing.
    •CloudFront can return different objects to viewers based on the device they're using by checking the User-Agent header, which includes information about the devices. For example, CloudFront can return different images based on the screen size of their device. Similarly, the function could consider the value of the Referer header and cause CloudFront to return the images to bots that have the lowest available resolution.
    •Or you could check cookies for other criteria. For example, on a retail website that sells clothing, if you use cookies to indicate which color a user chose for a jacket, a Lambda function can change the request so that CloudFront returns the image of a jacket in the selected color.
    •A Lambda function can generate HTTP responses when CloudFront viewer request or origin request events occur.
    •A function can inspect headers or authorization tokens, and insert a header to control access to your content before CloudFront forwards the request to your origin.
    •A Lambda function can also make network calls to external resources to confirm user credentials, or fetch additional content to customize a response
