Classless - IPV4 , IPV6
Classfull - CIDR

MAC vs IP : MEDIA-ACCESS-CONTROL ADDRESS  // INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS
--------------
Both MAC Address and IP Address are used to uniquely identify a machine on the internet.
--> MAC address is provided by the chip
    IP Address is provided by the Internet Service Provider.
--> MAC identifies the device participating in a network
    IP identifies the network / connection participating
--> MAC is a 48-bit addresses
    IP is a 32 bit address ipv4 and 128 bits for IPV6
--> D8-D3-85-EB-12-E3 -> D8-D3-85 [ address of manufacturer ] EB-12-E3 [ system address ]

STATEFUL [ FTP / TELNET ] VS STATELESS [ HTTP / DNS ] :
----------------------------------------------------------
The difference between stateful vs. stateless is essentially whether or not an application or process stores data over time.
Stateful applications store data, while stateless applications do not.
These devices in stateful connections  track source and destination IP addresses, as well as protocol or port information in an active connections table, which handles statistics of a network's active connections.
Stateful devices also inspect the packet payload to verify that the device contains the appropriate data.
Payload inspection might monitor a TCP handshake between devices, for example.
Because stateful devices save the connection information, the devices can reference that data when subsequent packets pass through the same connection.
Thus, the firewall can recognize packets that are part of existing and permitted connections, while also easily differentiating between legitimate and nonlegitimate connections.
The saved data in the connections table continuously updates as connections form, age and expire.
If a stateful firewall no longer sees packets passing over an established connection, after a while, that connection will time out and drop from the established connections state table.
Additionally, if communications restarted after the connection dropped from the table, the connection would need to go through the setup process over again.


    Network-1                                           Network-2
---------------------                                 --------------------
|   HOST-1          |                                 |  HOST-2          |
|                   |       www.google.com            |                  |
|                   | ----------------------------> a | ---> b --> c [p] |  [ P = Process / port ]
---------------------                                 --------------------
          1                                                     2
1 = Your Network say AIRTEL                        2 = Say a Network that hosts GOOGLE in Usage
    It has your HOST                                   It has a Host that serves google pages

When you type in www.google.com , it has to first :
  a --> Go to the destination network (using Network-Id in IP)
  b --> from destination , it has to identify the host that serves webpages (using Host-Id in IP)
  c --> from the host it has to identify the process to request for pages transfer (using Port number)

So we need to somehow translate the domain name into IP address.
IP ADDRESS = NETWORK-Id + HOST-Id
             Network-Id is used to reach Network and then Host-Id is used to reach the destination host .
PORT       = This specifies the process running the desired web pages .
             Ex : for a webservice on HTTP -> Default is PORT-80 (we need not specify port for default ports)
                  ftp - 21 etc;

For this Address translation, ISP (Internet Service Provider) will use a DNS (Domain Name Server).
This DNS info is cached for not go to DNS all the time . That's why the first time it is rum , pages take time but from next time they are quick.

NUMBER SYSTEM:
---------------
If the base of a number system is " n " :
--> Then we have " n " symbols in that number system and they all start from 0 and then 1 2 3 4 5 ...... (n-1)

UNARY NUMBER SYSTEM   :   0                   [ 1 = 0 && 2 = 00 && 3 = 000           ]
BINARY NUMBER SYSTEM  :   0 1                 [ Computer language                    ]      base = 2
OCTAL NUMBER SYSTEM   :   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7                                                   base = 8
DECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM :   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 [ Everyday used                        ]      base = 10
HEXA NUMBER SYSTEM    :   0 1 .... 9 A B .. f [ Since only 9 numbers , we use A to F ]      base = 16
                                                --> A = 11, B = 12 .... F = 15

2^1 = 2
2^2 = 4
.
.
2^10 = 1024 also called " K "
2^20 = M mega
2^30 = G giga
2^40 = T tera

      1-bit - 2 numbers                     2-bits - 4 numbers                       3-bits - 8 numbers
  ---------------                       -------------                              -----------
       0                                      00 10                                   000 001 010 100
       1                                      01 11                                   101 110 011 111

So for a "n" bit number , we have 2^n numbers called the ADDRESS SPACE .
So if we chose n bits as N/W ID             --> 2^n
The other n-k bits will be for Host Id part --> 2^(n-k)
IPV4 = 32 bits --> 4 blocks*8bits [ block-1 : block-2 : block-3 : block-4 ]

CONVERT BINARY TO DECIMAL : ( n^0 = 1 )
-----------------------------
111001    = 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 57
00        = 0*2^1 + 0*2^0  = 0
11        = 1*2^1 + 1*2^0  = 3
1000 0000 = 1*2^7 + 0*2^6 + 0*2^5 + 0*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 128
1111 1111 = 1*2^7 + 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 255

BINARY FORMAT :
-----------------
Out of 32 bits , if the binary addresses starts with : [ 0000 0000 . 0000 0000 . 0000 0000 . 0000 0000]
we have 8 octets of 4 bits each OR 4 blocks or 8 bits each . We consider the first OCTET for classification :

    --> 0     - class A  -- Since 1 bit  is  fixed out of 32 , we have (2^31) IP-Addresses -- [ 1   to 126 ]
    --> 10    - class B  -- Since 2 bits are fixed out of 32 , we have (2^30) IP-Addresses -- [ 128 to 191 ]
    --> 110   - class c  -- Since 3 bits are fixed out of 32 , we have (2^29) IP-Addresses -- [ 192 to 223 ]
    --> 1110  - class D  -- Since 4 bits are fixed out of 32 , we have (2^28) IP-Addresses -- [ 224 to 231 ]
    --> 1111  - class E  -- Since 4 bits are fixed out of 32 , we have (2^28) IP-Addresses -- [ 225 to 255 ]

DECIMAL FORMAT :
------------------
But if an IP is given in DOTTED DECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM , consider the first OCTET [ 17.34.56.4 ] , consider 17
and convert 17 to binary and classify based on first bits.

CLASS A -->         -------------------------------------------------
                   |  8-bits |           24-bits                     |  --> 8-bits for N/W and 24-bits for HOST
                    -------------------------------------------------
                     N/W - ID               HOST - ID

    Since we have 32 bits and 1st bit is fixed [ X _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ] , we have 31 remaining bits .

                       2^7   N/W ID's    = 128 Networks        [ N/W 0 to N/W 127 ]
                       2^24  HOST ID's   = 16 million hosts

    So we have 16 million IP addresses for each of the 2^7 Network. --> [ 0 to 127 ]
    But We do not use IP's starting with 0 and 127 for special purposes , so practically we have 126 Networks [ 1 to 126]
    So if we have an IP ADDRESS that starts with 1 - 126 , it is belonging to CLASS-A.
    Since only minimal (126) networks and huge (16 million) hosts , big giants such as Pentagon and NASA buy them .

CLASS B -->         -------------------------------------------------
                   |          16-bits     |           16-bits        |  --> 16-bits for N/W and 16-bits for HOST
                    -------------------------------------------------
                            N/W - ID                   HOST - ID

    Since we have 32 bits and 2-bits  are fixed [ X X _ _ _ _ _ _ ] , we have 30 remaining bits .

                      2^14   N/W  ID's   ~  16000 Networks        [ N/W 128 to N/W 191 ]
                      2^16   HOST ID's

    So we have 2^16  IP addresses for each of the 2^14 Networks. --> [ 128 to 191 ]
    So if we have an IP ADDRESS that starts with 128 - 191 , it is belonging to CLASS-B.
    Companies such as Pentagon and SBI and IRCTC buy them .


CLASS C -->         -------------------------------------------------
                   |          24-bits                    |   8-bits  |  --> 24-bits for N/W and 8-bits for HOST
                    -------------------------------------------------
                                   N/W - ID                  HOST - ID

    Since we have 32 bits and 2-bits  are fixed [ X X X _ _ _ _ _ ] , we have 29 remaining bits .

                      2^21   N/W  ID's  ~  2million Networks        [ N/W 192 to N/W 223 ]
                      2^8    HOST ID's  =  256

    So we have 256 IP addresses for each of the 2^21 Networks. --> [ 192 to 223 ]
    So if we have an IP ADDRESS that starts with 192 - 223 , it is belonging to CLASS-B.
    Universities and colleges buy these.

CLASS D and CLASS E :
    There is no concept of N/W ID and HOST ID here . All the addresses are simple IP addresses.
    But the range of CLASS D is : 224 to 231 --> used for multi casting
    And the range of CLASS E is : 232 to 255 --> Reserved for secure purposes such as military .

NOTE : Even the first and last host IP's are reserved in every class . --> UNICASTING and MULTICASTING
       So practically we have hosts as (total hosts - 2 )
       So for class A --> 16 million - 2
              class C --> 256 - 2

       LIMITED BROADCAST ADDRESS  --> 255.255.255.255 --> used for limited broad casting , so not assigned to any host .
       NETWORK ID                 --> X.0.0.0         --> represents the whole Network X
       DIRECTED BROADCAST ADDRESS --> X.255.255.255   --> represent all hosts in network X

       Consider 11.0.0.0 , 25.0.0.0 , 221.0.0.0
           --> These are not used as IP addresses but used as NETWORK ID's to represent a NETWORK .
           --> So the first IP address is always reserved (X.0.0.0)
           --> 1st IP is used to represent the whole Network .

RESERVED PRIVATE ADDRESSES :
-----------------------------
10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255
176.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

CASTING :
------------
UNI casting    - one host to one host    --   [ DATA - SOURCE_IP - DESTINATION_IP ]  <--> [ data - 11.1.2.3 - 12.1.2.3 ]
                 MAC address is used for unicasting similar to the static private address.

BROAD casting  - one host to many hosts

                 LIMITED  -> sending messages from one host to all hosts in the same network
                             Suppose we want to send a message from 11.1.2.3 to all hosts in same network 11 -> 11.x.x.x
                             since that for a class A , 2^16 hosts are there , it is practically not possible to send 2^16 data packets .
                             so the alternative is to put all 1's in destination Ip part . --> [255.255.255.255]
                             [ data - 11.1.2.3 - 255.255.255.255 ]
                             So When a Network sees the destination IP as 255.255.255.255 , instead of routing it out if its network, it sends it inside to all hosts again.

                 DIRECTED -> sending messages from one host to all hosts in a different network
                             Suppose we want to send a message from 11.1.2.3 to all hosts in different network 12 -> 12.x.x.x
                             So we put all 1's in the last 3 octets and 1st octet is the N/W Id. --> [X.255.255.255]
                             [ data - 11.1.2.3 - 20.255.255.255 ]

EXAMPLES :
------------
1.2.3.4            --> since starts with 1 , it is a CLASS A  -- 1st octet N/W id , next 3octets HOST Id.
                       so split as [ 1  -  2.3.4 ]
                       N/W id is the network the IP belongs = put all 0's in Host ID part
                       N/W ID = 1.0.0.0
                       DBA    = 1.255.255.255
                       LBA    = 255.255.255.255

150.3.150.150      --> since starts with 150 , it is a CLASS B -- First 2 octets N/W id , next 2 octets HOST Id.
                       so split as [ 150.3  - 150.150 ]
                       N/W id = the network the IP belongs = put all 0's in Host ID part
                       N/W ID = 150.3.0.0
                       DBA    = 150.3.255.255
                       LBA    = 255.255.255.255

220.15.1.10        --> since starts with 220 , it is a CLASS c -- First 3 octets N/W id , last octet is HOST Id.
                       so split as [ 220.15.1 - 10 ]
                       N/W id = the network the IP belongs = put all 0's in Host ID part
                       N/W ID = 220.15.1.0
                       DBA    = 220.15.1.255
                       LBA    = 255.255.255.255

250.1.2.3          --> since starts with 250  , it is a CLASS E
                       Since we do not have concept of N/W and HOST Id in class D and E , not possible .

300.1.2.3          --> 300 is not a valid range for any IP


SUBNETS :
-----------
Since that maintaining huge number of hosts is a difficult job , we divide a network into multiple networks for a better maintenance .
say in a company divide network into subnets for Developers , testers and admins.
But now there is an extra overhead of searching for the subnet in  a network .
Also every subnet wastes an extra of 2 IP addresses for DBA and N/W ID .

Consider a N/W : 200.1.2.0 --> since its class C , we use the last 8 bits as Host ID , hence we use these 8 bits for subnetting as well.
                           --> 200.1.2.X --> 200.1.2._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
                           --> If we want 2 subnets , we chose the 1st bit , if we want 4 subnets , we chose the 1st 2 bits.
                           --> Say we want to create 2 subnets A and B :
                           --> 200.1.2.0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  and 200.1.2.1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (we chose the 1st bit of the last octant and gave it 0 and 1 respectively)
                           --> When we have a subnet we need to have an internal route table to move traffic to respective subnets.

                                                     N/W Id = 200.1.2.0  <-- 200.1.2.0  -->  DBA = 200.1.2.255
                                                               ------------------------------------

                  RANGE =       200.1.2.0 to 200.1.2.127                       |                          200.1.2.128 to 200.1.2.255
    N/W ID or SUBNET-ID =       200.1.2.0                                    YYYYY                        200.1.2.128
                    DBA =       200.1.2.127                                                               200.1.2.255

                                                                   XXXXX = Internal Route table
                                                                   YYYYY = External Route table

The confusion is that : The N/W ID for whole network =  N/W ID of subnet A
                        The DBA of whole network     =  DBA of subnet B
--> This is eliminated by the route table that gets the request . The external route does not know about internal Subnets . It only sends data.
--> If you are talking about 200.1.2.0 from outside , you mean for whole network , if you are talking from inside it is for Subnet-A .
--> So there is  a packet 200.1.2.255
    --> From outside : say from ecternal route table YYYYY to XXXXX , then it is sent to all hosts in the total network (for both subnets A and B)
    --> From inside  : say a packet from subnet A , then it will be routed to Subnet B (because its DBA is 200.1.2.255)

SIMILARLY FOR 4 SUBNETS :
    A --> 0   - 63     N/W ID : 200.1.2.0
    B --> 64  - 127    N/W ID : 200.1.2.64
    C --> 128 - 191    N/W ID : 200.1.2.128
    D --> 192 - 255    N/W ID : 200.1.2.192


SUBNET MASK : [ Used by an internal route table for finding the NETWORK - ID i.e; the NETWORK the host belongs to ]
----------------
Subnet mask is a 32 bit number containing 0's and 1's .
        --> 1's : Represent N/W ID & Subnet ID part
        --> 0's : Represent HOST ID part

STEP 1 : [ Create the Subnet Mask ] --> Main Network : 200.1.2.0
         Place 1's in the N/W ID & Subnet ID part and 0's in HOST ID port.

                --> For 2 subnets : 200.1.2. X _ _ _ _ _ _ _
                    Subnet mask   : 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1 000 0000  ( Since we use 1st bit only ) -- 255.255.255.128

                --> For 4 subnets : 200.1.2. X X _ _ _ _ _ _
                                  : 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 11 00 0000  ( Since we use 1st 2-bits ) --- 255.255.255.192

STEP 2 : [ Convert IP into Binary and do an AND operation ] --> If we have 4 SUBNETS

    FOR 4 SUBNETS :
    A --> 0   - 63     N/W ID : 200.1.2.0
    B --> 64  - 127    N/W ID : 200.1.2.64
    C --> 128 - 191    N/W ID : 200.1.2.128
    D --> 192 - 255    N/W ID : 200.1.2.192

         EXAMPLE 1 : IP : 200.1.2.130
            --> SUBNET MASK    :  255.255.255.192  = 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1100 0000  (4 subnets)
            --> DESTINATION IP :  200.1.2.130      = 1100 1000 . 0000 0001 . 0000 0010 . 1000 0010
                                                  -----------------------------------------------
                                   AND OPERATION   =  1100 1000 . 0000 0001 . 0000 0010 . 1000 0000   = 200.1.2.128 --> NETWORK ID // SUBNET ID
                                                  ------------------------------------------------
         EXAMPLE 2 : IP : 200.1.2.10
            --> SUBNET MASK    :  255.255.255.192  = 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1100 0000  (4 subnets)
            --> DESTINATION IP :  200.1.2.10       = 1100 1000 . 0000 0001 . 0000 0010 . 0000 1010
                                                   -----------------------------------------------
                                  AND OPERATION    = 1100 1000 . 0000 0001 . 0000 0010 . 0000 0000   = 200.1.2.0 --> NETWORK ID // SUBNET ID
                                                   ------------------------------------------------

ROUTE TABLE FOR A SUBNET :
---------------------------
Consider the below subnets and their interfaces :
    A --> 0   - 63     N/W ID : 200.1.2.0
    B --> 64  - 127    N/W ID : 200.1.2.64
    C --> 128 - 191    N/W ID : 200.1.2.128
    D --> 192 - 255    N/W ID : 200.1.2.192
    E --> External Router to INTERNAL ROUTER LINK

    --> When a router gets a request with a DESTINATION-IP , then it will do an "AND" with SUBNET-MASK.
    --> If the output matches with 1st NETWORK-ID , it will look at the INTERFACE and route the packet to that Interface.
    --> If the 1st entry is a mismatch , it will search with the 2nd entry and so on ....
    --> If none of the entries match , the default will always match , means the packet does not belong to this network .

                      NETWORK-ID          SUBNET-MASK       INTERFACE
                    -----------------------------------------------------
                      200.1.2.0         255.255.255.192         A
                      200.1.2.64        255.255.255.192         B
                      200.1.2.128       255.255.255.192         C
                      200.1.2.192       255.255.255.192         D
                      0.0.0.0           0.0.0.0                 E    [  DEFAULT INTERFACE ]


CLASSLESS INTER DOMAIN ROUTING (CIDR) : (No concept of CLASSES)
------------------------------------------
The issue with classfull addresses is that :
    --> Even though you want 100 IP's , you have to buy a class C IP.
    --> And if you want more than 256 , say 300 we need to buy a Class B IP , which has 2^16 IP's
    --> There is a huge wastage in IP addresses . Hence CIDR.

In CIDR , we do not have a concept of CLASS. We have BLOCK concept.
We are assigned the exact number of IP's we request for .
So NETWORK ID is called as BLOCK ID in CIDR.
The disadvantage of CIDR is that we do not know the number of N/W id and HoST ID bits in the IP assigned .

So to overcome this , CIDR = a.b.c.d /n [ where n = number of bits in N/W id. ]
  20.4.56.124 / 20  --> This means there are 20 N/W ID bits and (32-20) , 12 HOST Id bits. --> Block has 2^12 IP addresses
  10.45.56.102 / 12 --> This means there are 12 N/W ID bits and (32-12) , 20 HOST Id bits. --> Block has 2^20 IP addresses

So for an IP , a.b.c.d / n -> N/W Id bits  = n
                              HOST Id bits = 32-n
                              IP Addresses = 2^(32-n)
Rules for forming a CIDR :
--> All IP's should be contiguous
--> A block requested should always be a power of 2 - (2^n)
    so you can not request 50 IP's , rather 64 IP's
--> First IP address in a block should be evenly divisible by size of block. Size means the total number of IP's.
    The reason being that such an IP has the 0's in the last octet and hence can be used an BLOCK-Id.

VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD :
==========================
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined.
Amazon VPC is the networking layer for Amazon EC2.
It is dedicated to your AWS account and is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud.

•  vpc              — A virtual network dedicated to your AWS account.
•  Subnet           — A range of IP addresses in your VPC.
                      You can launch AWS resources into a specified subnet.
                      Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet, and
                      Use a private subnet for resources that won't be connected to the internet .
                      To protect the AWS resources in each subnet, you can use multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists (ACL).
•  Route table      — A set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.
                      You can explicitly associate a subnet with a particular route table. Otherwise, the subnet is implicitly associated with the main route table.
•  Internet gateway — A gateway that you attach to your VPC to enable communication between resources in your VPC and the internet.
•  VPC endpoint     — Enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by Private Link without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.
                      Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service.
                      Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.
•  CIDR block       — Classless Inter-Domain Routing. An internet protocol address allocation and route aggregation methodology.

DEFAULT VPC & SUBNET : -> VPC spans across all Availability Zones . But you can create a Subnet in any AZ as you like.
-----------------------
    Our account  comes with a default VPC that has a default subnet in each Availability Zone.
    Your default VPC includes an internet gateway, and each default subnet is a public subnet.
    Each instance that you launch into a default subnet has a private IPv4 address and a public IPv4 address.
    These instances can communicate with the internet through the internet gateway.
    An internet gateway enables your instances to connect to the internet through the Amazon EC2 network edge.
    The default subnets have a main route table which is connected to INTERNET Gateway
    You can explicitly associate a subnet (default/non-default) with a particular route table.
    Otherwise, the subnet is implicitly associated with the main route table.

            ROUTE TABLE :  DESTINATION         TARGET
                           -------------------------------------
                           172.31.0.0/16       Local
                           0.0.0.0/0           Internet Gateway  --> Non default subnets do not have this entry , we need to specify.

      *** C and D are in different AVAILABILITY ZONES , 1 and 2 // Not shown due to diagram complexity.

--> By default, each instance that you launch into a nondefault subnet has a private IPv4 address, but no public IPv4 address.
    You need to assign one at launch, or you modify the subnet's public IP address attribute.
    These instances can communicate with each other, but can't access the internet.
    So you do not have a DEFAULT ENTRY in the route table stating a rule -->  0.0.0.0/0  for a non default subnet

NON-DEFAULT VPC & SUBNET : IPV4
---------------------------------
### Always create VPC using VPC DASHBOARD --> LAUNCH VPC WIZARD and not from MY VPC console.

--> If a subnet's traffic is routed to an internet gateway, the subnet is known as a public subnet.
    If you want your instance in a public subnet to communicate with the internet over IPv4, it must have a public IPv4 address or an Elastic IP address (IPv4)
    If you want your instance in the public subnet to communicate with the internet over IPv6, it must have an IPv6 address.
    If a subnet doesn't have a route to the internet gateway, the subnet is known as a private subnet.
    If a subnet doesn't have a route to the internet gateway, but has its traffic routed to a virtual private gateway for a Site-to-Site VPN connection, the subnet is known as a VPN-only subnet.
    If you create more than one subnet in a VPC, the CIDR blocks of the subnets cannot overlap.
    The smallest CIDR block you can specify is /28, and the largest is /16. Preferable in the range of 10.0.0.0/16, or 192.168.0.0/16
    Once created , we can later add extra CIDR blocks (non-overlapping only) AWS --> VPC --> Select VPC --> Actions --> edit CIDR blocks --> add new CIDR
    Similar steps to delete a CIDR as well. (Min 1 CIDR is required)
    We can delete a default VPC and default subnets as well.

--> The first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are not available for you touse, and cannot be assigned to an instance.
    •10.0.0.0: Network address.
    •10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.
    •10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS as address of the DNS server
    •10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.•10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address.
    So for a.b.c.d/n CIDR , the number of hosts available are 2^(32-2) and hosts we can actually use are [ (2^(32-n)) - 5 ]

--> You can associate secondary IPv4 CIDR blocks with your VPC.
    When you associate a CIDR block with your VPC, a route is automatically added to your VPC route tables to enable routing within the VPC .

--> The VPC that you created by default has two route tables — a main route table that all VPCs have by default, and a custom route table that was created by the wizard.
    The custom route table is associated with your subnet, which means that the routes in that table determine how the traffic for the subnet flows.
    If you add a new subnet to your VPC, it uses the main route table by default.

--> You can enable internet access for an instance launched into a nondefault subnet by attaching an internet gateway to its VPC (if its VPC is not a default VPC)
    and associating an Elastic IP address with the instance.

--> Say we have a NON-DEFAULT VPC : 10.0.0.0/16 and 2-NON_DEFAULT SUBNETS : 10.0.0.0/24  & 10.0.1.0/24
    If you attach Elastic IP to one of the non-default subnet and leave other non-default subnet as it is , we then have 2 routing tables ,
    We have a custom route for the one attached to elastic IP's and the other subnet stays for internal communication.

    CUSTOM ROUTE TABLE :  DESTINATION         TARGET                                 MAIN ROUTE TABLE :  DESTINATION         TARGET
                            -------------------------------------                                          -------------------------------------
                            10.0.0.0/24       Local                                                        10.0.1.0/24       Local
                            0.0.0.0/0         Internet Gateway

--> Public subnet means a subnet that has a route to Internet gateway .
    This does not mean the instances created in it will be able to connect to internet .
    By default the instance does not get an Public IP , so to be able to connect it to internet , we need to assign it an ELASTIC IP .

--> Before you can delete a VPC, you must terminate any instances that are running in the VPC.
    You can then delete the VPC and its components using the VPC console

--> when you create a NON-DEFAULT VPC, you will be also needed to  provide the NON-DEFAULT SUBNET details .
    say VPC is 10.0.0.0/16 then SUBNET will be 10.0.0.0/24
    Once done DHCP takes care to associate a ROUTE TABLE (main , custom) and an INTERNET GATEWAY.
    Then we can launch an Instance in our VPC and then select the Subnet .
    Now we need to associate it with an ELASTIC IP to make it public instance , remember to disassociate and then release the ELASTIC IP once done .
    In the wizard , we will be also asked to select the AVAILABILITY ZONE where we want to create the VPC in that region.

--> Alternatively , if you also want to associate the VPC with IPV6 , in the wizard , select the option for IPV6 CIDR block.
    So now you will have both IPV4 and IPV6 CIDR blocks associated to VPC.
    Then we may or may not assign IPV6 to the subnet .
    So for instances launched in this VPC , we can also assign IPV6 addresses.
    But we must make sure we configure the route table to allow IPV6 as well

--> You can optionally add subnets in a Local Zone.
    It is an AWS infrastructure deployment that places compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to your end users.
    Not all Regions have local Zones that support this functionality.
    A Local Zone enables your end users to run applications that require single-digit millisecond latencies.

--> Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones.
    Availability Zones are distinct locations that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones.
    By launching instances in separate Availability Zones, you can protect your applications from the failure of a single location

--> Your resources can communicate over IPv4, or IPv6, or both.
    IPv4 and IPv6 communication are independent of each other.
    You cannot disable IPv4 support for your VPC and subnets; this is the default IP addressing system for Amazon VPC and Amazon EC2.


NON-DEFAULT VPC & SUBNET : IPV6
--------------------------------
Similar to creating a IPV4.
The VPC CIDR block size is fixed at /56.
The subnet CIDR block size is fixed at /64.
You can connect to your instance through its IPv6 address using SSH or Remote Desktop from your home network.
Your local computer must have an IPv6 address and must be configured to use IPv6.
If you also want your instance to be accessible via an IPv4 address over the internet, SSH, or RDP, you must associate an Elastic IP address
And you must adjust your security group rules to allow access over IPv4.

If you associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC and subnet, your route table must include separate routes for IPv6 traffic.
The following table shows the custom route table for this scenario if you choose to enable IPv6 communication in your VPC.
The second entry is the default route that's automatically added for local routing in the VPC over IPv6.
The fourth entry routes all other IPv6 subnet traffic to the internetgateway.
        Destination                            Target
        ----------------------------------------------
        10.0.0.0/16                            local
        2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56                local [ Mandatory to put both IPV4 and IPv6 as well ]
        0.0.0.0/0                              igw-id
        ::/0                                   igw-id

 --> Your instance in a VPC receives an IPv6 address if an IPv6 CIDR block is associated with your VPC and your subnet, and if one of the following is true:
        •  Your subnet is configured to automatically assign an IPv6 address to the primary network interface of an instance during launch.
        •  You manually assign an IPv6 address to your instance during launch.
        •  You assign an IPv6 address to your instance after launch.
        •  You assign an IPv6 address to a network interface in the same subnet, and attach the network interface to your instance after launch.

 --> When you delete a VPC using the VPC console, we also delete the following VPC components for you:
        •  Subnets    •  Security groups   •  Network ACLs    •  Route tables
        •  Gateway endpoints    •  Internet gateways   •  Egress-only internet gateways  •  DHCP options
 --> Before deleting , we need to make sure we :
        • Terminate all EC2 instances in that VPCs
        • VPC peering Connections
        • Interface endpoints
        • NAT gateways


DHCP :
-------
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol networks.
A DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on the network, so they can communicate with other IP networks.

INTERNET GATEWAY :
--------------------
An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that enables communication between your VPC and the internet.
There is a default IGW attached to your default VPC . An internet gateway supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
An internet gateway serves two purposes:
  --> To provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic, and
  --> To perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses.

To use an internet gateway, attach it to your VPC and specify it as a target in your subnet route table for internet-routable IPv4 or IPv6 traffic.
An internet gateway performs network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses.

To enable communication over the internet for IPv4, your instance must have a public IPv4 addressor an Elastic IP address that's associated with a private IPv4 address on your instance.
Your instance is only aware of the private (internal) IP address space defined within the VPC and subnet.
The internet gateway logically provides the one-to-one NAT on behalf of your instance, so that when traffic leaves your VPC subnet and goes to the internet, the reply address field is set to the public IPv4 address or Elastic IP address of your instance, and not its private IP address.
Conversely, traffic that's destined for the public IPv4 address or Elastic IP address of your instance has its destination address translated into the instance's private IPv4 address before the traffic is delivered to the VPC.


NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATOR (NAT): [Permit internet access to Instances in a private Subnet]
----------------------------------
    HOW NAT WORKS :
    ---------------
    Network Address Translation (NAT) is designed for IP address conservation.
    It enables private IP networks that use unregistered IP addresses to connect to the Internet.
    NAT operates on a router, usually connecting two networks together, and translates the private (not globally unique) addresses in the internal network into legal addresses, before packets are forwarded to another network.
    As part of this capability, NAT can be configured to advertise only one address [ ELASTIC IP ] for the entire network to the outside world.
    This provides additional security by effectively hiding the entire internal network behind that address.
    NAT offers the dual functions of security and address conservation and is typically implemented in remote-access environments.

To allow an instance in your VPC to initiate outbound connections to the internet but prevent unsolicited inbound connections from the internet,
you can use a network address translation(NAT) device for IPv4 traffic.
NAT maps multiple private IPv4 addresses to a single public IPv4 address.
A NAT device has an Elastic IP address and is connected to the internet through an internet gateway.
You can connect an instance in a private subnet to the internet through the NAT device, which routes traffic from the instance to the internet gateway, and routes any responses to the instance.
A Nat Gateway is an AWS managed instance that permits Internet traffic from instances sitting in a private subnet inside your VPC.

NAT INSTANCE vs NAT GATEWAY : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-comparison.html

INTERNET GATEWAY vs NAT GATEWAY : say you have two subnets and you launch instances in both the subnets.
    Now if you attach IGW in of the subnets, that subnet becomes public and now outside world can connect to that subnet.
    Means your instance is accessible from outside and your instance can connect to the outside world.

    But if you have a requirement that outside world will not able to connect to your instance, then that time you have to use NAT in your subnet and your subnet becomes private subnet.
    So every instance on that subnet can connect to the outside world but outside world will not able to connect to your instances.

### ADDITIONAL INFO: <Remove duplicates>

### To allow an instance in your VPC to initiate outbound connections to the internet but prevent unsolicited inbound connections from the internet.
### It has an ELASTIC IP associated with it that can be used by any number of Private IP's.

Used for instances staying in private subnet but wants to connect to internet and also does not want internet to access them .
A NAT gateway has its own Elastic IPv4 address.
Instances in the private subnet can send requests to the Internet through the NAT gateway over IPv4 (for example, for software updates)

Can be used if you have a public and private subnets in your VPC.
Example if you want to run a public-facing web application, while maintaining back-end servers that aren't publicly accessible.
The instances in the public subnet can send outbound traffic directly to the Internet, whereas the instances in the private subnet can't.
Instead, the instances in the private subnet can access the Internet by using a network address translation (NAT) gateway that resides in the public subnet.
The database servers can connect to the Internet for software updates using the NAT gateway, but the Internet cannot establish connections to the database servers.

CUSTOM ROUTE TABLE :  DESTINATION         TARGET                                 MAIN ROUTE TABLE :  DESTINATION         TARGET
                        -------------------------------------                                          -------------------------------------
                        10.0.0.0/16       Local                                                        10.0.1.0/16      Local
                        0.0.0.0/0         Internet Gateway                                             0.0.0.0/0        NAT Gateway

EGRESS ONLY INTERNET GATEWAY:
---------------------------------
### AS NAT IS FOR IPV4 , EGRESS IS FOR IPV6 .

A stateful gateway to provide egress only access for IPv6 traffic from the VPC to the Internet.
Similar to NAT but NAT is for IPV4 while EGRESS is for IPV6 .
IPv6 addresses are globally unique, and are therefore public by default.
An egress-only internet gateway  VPC component that allows outbound communication over IPv6 from instances in your VPC to the internet.
It prevents the internet from initiating an IPv6 connection with your instances.

An egress-only internet gateway is stateful: it forwards traffic from the instances in the subnet to the internet or other AWS services, and then sends the response back to the instances.
AWS --> VPC --> Egress only Gateways.

SECURITY GROUP :
--------------------
A security group acts as a virtual firewall to control the traffic for its associated instances.
To use a security group, add the inbound rules to control incoming traffic to the instance, and outbound rules to control the outgoing traffic from your instance.
To associate a security group with an instance, specify the security group when you launch the instance.
Your VPC comes with a default security group. Any instance not associated with another security group during launch is associated with the default security group.


VPC PEERING :
----------------
#### Can be used to allow communication between 2 EC2 instances across different regions in same or different ACCOUNTS .
#### You can connect any two VPCs in different AWS Regions, as long as they have distinct, non-overlapping CIDR blocks.

A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses.
Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.
You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account.
The VPCs can be in different regions (also known as an inter-region VPC peering connection).

You can create a VPC peering connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them privately.
Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.
You can also create a transit gateway and use it to interconnect your VPCs and on-premises networks.
The transit gateway acts as a Regional virtual router for traffic flowing between its attachments, which can include VPCs, VPN connections, AWS Direct Connect gateways, and transit gateway peering connections.

There is no physical hardware involved in peering . -->  AWS -> vpc -> peering Connections -> CREATE / ACCEPT etc;
Sender will create a request and the receiver must accept the request . We specify the VPC id's in the request made .
oth sender and receiver must update route tables accordingly.

SAME ACCOUNT :
    -> vpc to vpc in same region -> specify MY ACCUNT -> enter VPC ID (receiver)
    -> vpc to vpc in cross regions -> Specify MY ACCOUNT -> Specify REGION -> enter VPC ID (receiver)

DIFFERENT  ACCOUNT :
    -> vpc to vpc in same region -> specify OTHER ACCUNT -> enter VPC ID (receiver)
    -> vpc to vpc in cross regions -> Specify OTHER ACCOUNT -> Specify REGION -> enter VPC ID (receiver)

RECIEVER ACCEPTANCE :
    -> AWS -> vpc -> peering Connections -> pending Acceptance ->Accept


SECURITY IN VPC : [ SECURITY GROUPS & N/W-ACL ]
------------------------------------------------
AWS provides two features that you can use to increase security in your VPC: security groups and network ACLs.
Security groups control inbound and outbound traffic for your instances, and network ACLs control inbound and outbound traffic for your subnets.
In most cases, security groups can meet your needs; however, you can also use network ACLs if you want an additional layer of security for your VPC.

      SECURITY GROUPS :
      --------------------
      Your VPC comes with a default security group.
      An instance that's launched into the VPC is automatically associated with the default security group if you don't specify a different security group during launch.
      You can add specific rules to the default security group, but the recommendation is to create a custom and attach.
      When you create a security group, it has a single outbound rule that allows all traffic to leave the instance.
      You must modify the rules to enable inbound traffic and restrict the outbound traffic as needed .
      If there are IPV6 instances , we need to add IPV6 addresses and ranges as well .

      Your VPC automatically comes with a default security group.
      If you don't specify a different security group when you launch the instance, we associate the default security group with your instance.

                                                          for any custom security group you create, you must manually add the rule to allow this type of communication.

VPC FLOW LOGS :
------------------
VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.
Flow log data can be published to Amazon Cloud Watch Logs or AmazonS3.
After you've created a flow log, you can retrieve and view its data in the chosen destination
You can create a flow log for a VPC, a subnet, or a network interface.
If you create a flow log for a subnet or VPC, each network interface in that subnet or VPC is monitored.
To create a flow log, you specify:
  •  The resource for which to create the flow log
  •  The type of traffic to capture (accepted traffic, rejected traffic, or all traffic)
  •  The destinations to which you want to publish the flow log data

ELASTIC NETWORK INTERFACE :
------------------------------
An elastic network interface  is a virtual network interface that can include the following attributes:
  •  a primary private IPv4 address
  •  one or more secondary private IPv4 addresses
  •  one Elastic IP address per private IPv4 address
  •  one public IPv4 address, which can be auto-assigned to the network interface for eth0 when you launch an instance
  •  one or more IPv6 addresses•  one or more security groups
  •  a MAC address
  •  a source/destination check flag•  a description
You can create a network interface, attach it to an instance, detach it from an instance, and attach it to another instance.
A network interface's attributes follow it as it is attached or detached from an instance and reattached to another instance.
When you move a network interface from one instance to another, network traffic is redirected to the new instance.
Each instance in your VPC has a default network interface (the primary network interface) that is assigned a private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC.
You cannot detach a primary network interface from an instance. You can create and attach an additional network interface to any instance in your VPC.

ELASTIC IP's : -> Add more data. ENI vs EIP **
----------------
Elastic IP of a server A can be attached to Server B and requests will now go from Server A to Server B.
We can connect multiple Public Ip's to a server by attaching multiple Elastic Network Interfaces to it .
Useful if we want to run multiple apps on the same port or if you want to host multiple websites using fixed public IP.
Now a server can serve 2 websites because it has 2 public IP's . It serves website based on the IP present in the request packet.

ROUTE TABLES :
-----------------
  •  Main route table     — The route table that automatically comes with your VPC.
                            It controls the routing for all subnets that are not explicitly associated with any other route table.
  •  Custom route table   — A route table that you create for your VPC.
  •  Edge association     — A route table that you use to route inbound VPC traffic to an appliance.
                            You associate a route table with the internet gateway or virtual private gateway, and specify the network interface of your appliance as the target for VPC traffic.
  •  Route association    — The association between a route table and a subnet, internet gateway, or virtual private gateway.
  •  Subnet route table   — A route table that's associated with a subnet.
  •  Gateway route table  — A route table that's associated with an internet gateway or virtual private gateway.
  •  Local gateway route  — A route table that's associated with an Outposts local gateway.
  •  Destination          — The range of IP addresses where you want traffic to go (destination CIDR).
                            For example, an external corporate network with a 172.16.0.0/12 CIDR.
  •  Propagation          — Route propagation allows a virtual private gateway to automatically propagate routes to the route tables.
                            This means that you don't need to manually enter VPN routes to your route tables.


VPC ENDPOINT : [ An endpoint is a URL that is the entry point for a web service ]
----------------
A virtual device that enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS Private Link.
It does not require an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.
Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service.
Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.

VPC -> Endpoints -> create an end point -> service category -> service names
In service names , in the TYPE field, we have interface and gateway endpoint selections .
we have gateway only for S3 and DYNAMO DB. [ check the TYPE filed column ]

  • VPC endpoint — The entry point in your VPC that enables you to connect privately to a service.
    The following are the different types of VPC endpoints. You create the type of VPC endpoint required by the supported service.
      •  Gateway endpoint
      •  Interface endpoint
      •  Gateway Load Balancer endpoint
  •  Endpoint service — Your own application or service in your VPC. Other AWS principals can create an endpoint from their VPC to your endpoint service.
  •  AWS Private Link — A technology that provides private connectivity between VPCs and services  by using private IP addresses

      TYPE-1 : INTERFACE ENDPOINT --> AWS PRIVATE LINK
      -------------------------------
      An interface endpoint is an elastic network interface with a private IP address from the IP address range of your subnet.
      It serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported AWS service or a VPC endpoint service. Interface endpoints are powered by AWS Private Link
      Interface type endpoints provide private connectivity to services powered by Private Link, being AWS services, your own services or SaaS solutions, and supports connectivity over Direct Connect.
      Interface endpoints are typically accessed using the public or private DNS name associated with the service,
         These services include :
              some AWS services  --> AWS EC2 , etc;
              services hosted by other AWS customers
              Partners in their own VPCs (referred to as endpoint services), --> to an already created endpoint
              supported AWS Marketplace Partner
        The owner of the service is the service provider, and you, as the principal creating the interface endpoint, are the service consumer.
        VPC -> Endpoints -> create an end point -> service category

        Type-2 : GATEWAY LOAD BALANCER ENDPOINT --> AWS PRIVATE LINK
        ----------------------------------------
        A Gateway Load Balancer endpoint enables you to intercept traffic and route it to a service that you 've configured using Gateway Load Balancers, for example, for security inspection.
        The owner of the service is the service provider, and you, as the principal creating the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, are the service consumer.


        TYPE-3 : GATEWAY VPC ENDPOINTS
        ---------------------------------
        Gateway type endpoints are available only for AWS services including S3 and DynamoDB.
        These endpoints will add an entry to your route table you selected and route the traffic to the supported services through Amazon’s private network.
        gateway endpoints and Gateway Load Balancer endpoints serve as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined for the service.

AWS VPN CONNECTIONS :
-------------------------
You can connect your Amazon VPC to remote networks and users using the following VPN connectivity options.
By default, instances that you launch into an Amazon VPC can't communicate with your own (remote) network.
You can enable access to your remote network from your VPC by creating an AWS Site-to-Site VPN (Site-to-Site VPN) connection, and configuring routing to pass traffic through the connection.
You can create an IPsec VPN connection between your VPC and your remote network.
On the AWS side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection, a virtual private gateway or transit gateway provides two VPN endpoints (tunnels)for automatic failover.
You configure your customer gateway device on the remote side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.

The following are the key concepts for Site-to-Site VPN:

  VPN connection          : A secure connection between your on-premises equipment and your VPCs.
  VPN tunnel              : An encrypted link where data can pass from the customer network to or from AWS.
  Customer gateway        : An AWS resource which provides information to AWS about your customer gateway device.
  Customer gateway device : A physical device or software application on your side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.
  Virtual private gateway : The VPN concentrator on the Amazon side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.
                            You use a virtual private gateway or a transit gateway as the gateway for the Amazon side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.
  Transit gateway         : A transit hub that can be used to interconnect your VPCs and on-premises networks.
                            You use a transit gateway or virtual private gateway as the gateway for the Amazon side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.


DIRECT CONNECT :
----------------
AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fibre-optic cable.
One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router.
With this connection, you can create virtual interfaces directly to public AWS services (for example, to Amazon S3) or to Amazon VPC, bypassing internet service providers in your network path.
An AWS Direct Connect location provides access to AWS in the Region with which it is associated.
You can use a single connection in a public Region or AWS GovCloud (US) to access public AWS services in all other public Regions.

The following are the key components that you use for AWS Direct Connect:
    Connections        :  Create a connection in an AWS Direct Connect location to establish a network connection from your premises to an AWS Region.
    Virtual interfaces :  Create a virtual interface to enable access to AWS services.
                          A public virtual interface enables access to public services, such as Amazon S3.
                          A private virtual interface enables access to your VPC.


      VIRTUAL PRIVATE GATEWAY <----------------- VPN CONNECTION ---------------> CUSTOMER GATEWAY
           or TRANSIT GATEWAY                                                    for CORPORATE NETWORK

Accessing public services in a remote Region :
To access public resources in a remote Region, you must set up a public virtual interface and establisha Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) session.

Accessing VPCs in a remote Region :
You can create a Direct Connect gateway in any public Region. Use it to connect your AWS Direct Connectconnection over a private virtual interface to VPCs in your account that are located in different Regionsor to a transit gateway.


AWS GATEWAYS : CONNECTING CORPORATE NETWORKS : [ VIRTUAL PRIVATE GATEWAY & DIRECT CONNECT GATEWAY & TRANSIT GATEWAY ]
-----------------------------------------------
### We also have INTERNET GATEWAY AND EGRESS ONLY GATEWAYS apart from above , used to connect to open internet .
### You can optionally connect your VPC to your own corporate data centre using an IPsec AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection.

A Site-to-Site VPN connection consists of two VPN tunnels between :
    --> A virtual private gateway or transit gateway on the AWS side, and a customer gateway device located in your data centre .
    --> A customer gateway device is a physical device or software appliance that you configure on your side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.

    DIRECT CONNECT GATEWAY :   [2017]    [ CHECK DIAGRAM : 20 ]
    -------------------------------------------
    It uses the concept of DIRECT CONNECT .
    A Direct Connect gateway is a globally available resource. You can create the Direct Connect gateway in any Region and access it from all other Regions.

    In the diagram-20 : [Across same account]
    The Direct Connect gateway enables you to use your AWS Direct Connect connection in the US East (N. Virginia) Region to access VPCs in your account in both the US East (N. Virginia) and US West (N. California) Regions.
    Each VPC has a virtual private gateway that connects to the Direct Connect gateway using a virtual private gateway association.
    The Direct Connect gateway uses a private virtual interface for the connection to the AWS Direct Connect location.
    There is an AWS Direct Connect connection from the location to the customer data center.

    In the duagram-21 : [Across different accounts]
    A Direct Connect gateway owner (Account Z)  owns the Direct Connect gateway.
    Account A and Account B want to use the Direct Connect gateway.
    Account A and Account B each send an association proposal to Account Z.
    Account Z accepts the association proposals and can optionally update the prefixes that are allowed from Account A's virtual private gateway or Account B's virtual private gateway.
    After Account Z accepts the proposals, Account A and Account B can route traffic from their virtual private gateway to the Direct Connect gateway.
    Account Z also owns the routing to the customers because Account Z owns the gateway.

    It uses either of the following :

        VIRTUAL PRIVATE GATEWAY :
        ------------------------------------
        You can optionally connect your VPC to your own corporate data centre using an IPsec AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection,
        Instead of an Internet Gateway , we use a VIRTUAL PRIVATE GATWAY.
        A Site-to-Site VPN connection consists of two VPN tunnels between a virtual private gateway or transit gateway on the AWS side, and a customer gateway device located in your data centre.

        CUSTOM ROUTE TABLE :    DESTINATION         TARGET                                 MAIN ROUTE TABLE :  DESTINATION         TARGET
                                -------------------------------------                                          -------------------------------------
                                10.0.0.0/24       Local                                                        10.0.1.0/24       Local
                                0.0.0.0/0         VIRTUAL PRIVATE Gateway

        A virtual private gateway is a logical, fully redundant distributed edge routing function that sits at the edge of your VPC.
        As it is capable of terminating VPN connections from your on premises  or customer environments, the VPG is the VPN concentrator on the Amazon side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.
        This is one of the more mysterious components of the AWS networking core interface modules, as it represents the only way for you to terminate a VPN connection into your AWS cloud (that is until the Transit Gateway came on the scene…)

        In a nutshell, A Virtual Private Gateway is a way for you to land in your cloud when creating a VPN tunnel.
        You can create up to ten VPN tunnels to the exterior, Non-VPC networking locations per VPG interfaced and each of these tunnels will be connected using the IPSec protocol.


        TRANSIT GATEWAY :
        ------------------------------------
        A transit gateway is a network transit hub that you can use to interconnect your virtual private clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks.
        A transit gateway acts as a Regional virtual router for traffic flowing between your virtual private clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks.
        A transit gateway scales elastically based on the volume of network traffic.
        You can attach the following resources to your transit gateway:
            --> One or more VPC in same / cross regions
            --> One or more VPN connections
            --> One or more AWS Direct Connect gateways
            --> One or more Transit Gateway Connect attachments
            --> One or more transit gateway peering connections

        Create it from -> VPC -> Transit gateway -> Attach to VPC using Transit Gateway Attachments tab
        Now edit the TRANSIT GATEWAY ROUTE tables to connect to EC2 in other VPC .

        Diagram -22 -> Across single account ->
            Enables you to create a single connection to your Direct Connect connection that all of your VPCs can use.

        Diagram -23 -> Across multiple accounts ->
            Consider this scenario of a Direct Connect gateway owner (Account Z) who owns the Direct Connect gateway.
            Account A owns the transit gateway and wants to use the Direct Connect gateway.
            Account Z accepts the association proposals and can optionally update the prefixes that are allowed from Account A's transit gateway.
            After Account Z accepts the proposals, the VPCs attached to the transit gateway can route traffic from the transit gateway to the Direct Connect gateway.
            Account Z also owns the routing to the customers because Account Z owns the gateway

CONNECT RESOURCES EXPLICITLY : [ AWS DEVICE FARM <--> AWS PRIVATE LINK <--> VPC ENDPOINTS ]
----------------------------------
AWS Private Link provides private connectivity between VPCs and services hosted on AWS or on-premises, securely on the Amazon network.
By providing a private endpoint to access your services, AWS Private Link ensures your traffic is not exposed to the public internet.
AWS Private Link makes it easy to connect services across different accounts and VPCs to significantly simplify your network architecture.
It is a  technology that enables you to privately access AWS resources by using private IP addresses.
PrivateLink restricts all network traffic between your VPC and AWS resources to the Amazon network.


AWS Private Link is a highly available, scalable technology that enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services
IT can also connect  services hosted by other AWS accounts (VPC endpoint services), and supported AWS Marketplace partner services.
You do not require an internet gateway, NAT device, public IP address, AWS Direct Connect connection, or AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to communicate with the service.
Traffic between your VPC and the service does not leave the Amazon network.
To use AWS Private Link, create a VPC endpoint for a service in your VPC. You create the type of VPC endpoint required by the supported service.
This creates an elastic network interface in your subnet with a private IP address that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to the service.

    |-------------------------------------------------------- VPC ENDPOINT NETWORK INTERFACE -----------------------------------------------------------|

    #### Once the endpoint interface is established , we can use this for cross region communication .

     -----------------------------------------------------                                         -----------------------------------------------------
    |    EC2 -INSTANCE + VPC ENDPOINT N/W INTERFACE       | <xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx> | AWS RESOURCES [ SAME OR CROSS ACCOUNT ]             |

You can also create your own AWS Private Link-powered service (endpoint service) and enable other AWS customers to access your service.

SERVER & BROWSER :
---------------------
A server is a special computer connected directly to a computer .
It has webpages in its hard disk.
A web server contains all the data while a web browser helps displaying that data .
They use http or https to communicate among themselves.
