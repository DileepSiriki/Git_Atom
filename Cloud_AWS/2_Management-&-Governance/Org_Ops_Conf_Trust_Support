AWS ORGANIZATIONS :
==================================================================
AWS Organizations is an account management service that enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage.
AWS Organizations includes account management and consolidated billing capabilities that enable you to better meet the budgetary, security, and compliance needs of your business.
As an administrator of an organization, you can create accounts in your organization and invite existing accounts to join the organization.

  --> Centralized management of all of your AWS accounts
      You can combine your existing accounts into an organization that enables you to manage the accounts centrally.

  --> Consolidated billing for all member accounts
       management accounts can also access the billing information, account information, and account activity of member accounts in their organization.

  --> Hierarchical grouping of your accounts to meet your budgetary, security, or compliance needs
      You can group your accounts into organizational units (OUs) and attach different access policies to each OU.

  --> Policies to centralize control over the AWS services and API actions that each account can access.
      you can restrict which AWS services, resources, and individual API actions the users and roles in each member account can access.

  --> Policies to standardize tags across the resources in your organization's accounts.
      You can use tag policies to maintain consistent tags, including the preferred case treatment of tagkeys and tag values.

  --> Policies to control how AWS artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning services can collect and store data.
  --> Policies that configure automatic backups for the resources in your organization's accounts
  --> Integration and support for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

  --> Global access
      AWS Organizations is a global service with a single endpoint that works from any and all AWS Regions. You don't need to explicitly select a region to operate in.

  --> Data replication that is eventually consistent
      AAWS Organizations achieves high availability by replicating data across multiple servers in AWS data centers within its Region.
      If a request to change some data is successful, the change is committed and safely stored

  --> Free to use

ORGANIZATION UNIT [ OU ]:
--------------------------
A container for accounts  within a root .
An OU also can contain other OUs, enabling you to create a hierarchy that resembles an upside-down tree, with a root at the top and branches of OUs that reach down, ending in accounts that are the leaves of the tree.
When you attach a policy to one of the nodes in the hierarchy, it flows down and affects all the branches (OUs)and leaves (accounts) beneath it.
An OU can have exactly one parent, and currently each account can be a member of exactly one OU.

==================================================================
AWS CONFIG :
==================================================================
AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account.
This includes how the resources are related to one another and how they were configured in the past so that you can see how the configurations and relationships change over time.

With AWS Config, you can do the following:
  • Evaluate your AWS resource configurations for desired settings.
  • Get a snapshot of the current configurations of the supported resources that are associated with your AWS account.
  • Retrieve configurations of one or more resources that exist in your account.
  • Retrieve historical configurations of one or more resources.
  • Receive a notification whenever a resource is created, modified, or deleted.
  • View relationships between resources. For example, you might want to find all resources that use a particular security group.

  --> AWS Resources
      AWS resources are entities that you create and manage using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), the AWS SDKs, or AWS partner tools.

  --> Configuration History
      A configuration history is a collection of the configuration items for a given resource over any time period.
      A configuration history can help you answer questions about, for example, when the resource was first created, how the resource has been configured over the last month, and what configuration changes were introduced yesterday at 9 AM.
      You can select a given resource in the AWSConfig console and navigate to all previous configuration items for that resource using the timeline.

  --> Configuration Items
      A configuration item represents a point-in-time view of the various attributes of a supported AWS resource that exists in your account.
      The components of a configuration item include metadata, attributes, relationships, current configuration, and related events

  --> Configuration Recorder
      The configuration recorder stores the configurations of the supported resources in your account as configuration items.
      You must first create and then start the configuration recorder before you can start recording.
      You can stop and restart the configuration recorder at any time.

  --> Configuration Snapshot
      A configuration snapshot is a collection of the configuration items for the supported resources tha texist in your account.
      This configuration snapshot is a complete picture of the resources that are being recorded and their configurations.
      The configuration snapshot can be a useful tool for validating your configuration.

  --> Resource Relationship
      AWS Config discovers AWS resources in your account and then creates a map of relationships between AWS resources.
      For example, a relationship might include an Amazon EBS volume vol-123ab45dattached to an Amazon EC2 instance i-a1b2c3d4 that is associated with security group sg-ef678hk.

• Specifying the types of AWS resources for recording.
• Configuring resources to record, including:
    • Selecting an Amazon S3 bucket.
    • Selecting an Amazon SNS topic.
    • Creating AWS Config role.
• Creating managed rules and custom rules that represent desired configuration settings for specific AWS resources or for an entire AWS account.
• Creating and managing configuration aggregators to aggregate data across multiple accounts and regions.
• Viewing a snapshot of current configurations of the supported resources.
• Viewing relationships between AWS resources.

AWS TRUSTED ADVISOR : Cost Optimization -  Performance -  Security - Fault Tolerance -  Service Limits
==================================================================
AWS Trusted Advisor offers a rich set of best practice checks and recommendations across five categories:
cost optimization, security, fault tolerance, performance, and service limits.

AWS Trusted Advisor is your customized cloud expert! It helps you to observe best practices for the use of AWS by inspecting your AWS environment with an eye toward saving money, improving system performance and reliability, and closing security gaps.
All AWS customers can start optimizing their cloud resources by using four of AWS Trusted Advisor’s most popular best-practice recommendations on service limits and security configurations.
Access to the four free checks does not expire, and you can access the remaining 33 checks and additional features by upgrading to Business or Enterprise-level Support.

The four free checks include :
Security Groups - Specific Ports Unrestricted,
Service Limits,
IAM Use, and
MFA on Root Account

The core security checks include: (Important)
1- Security Groups - Specific Ports Unrestricted.
   Checks security groups for rules that allow unrestricted access to specific ports.
   Unrestricted access increases opportunities for malicious activity (hacking, denial-of-service attacks, loss of data).

2- Amazon S3 Bucket Permissions.
   Checks buckets in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) that have open access permissions.
   Bucket permissions that grant List access to everyone can result in higher than expected charges if objects in the bucket are listed by unintended users at a high frequency.
   Bucket permissions that grant Upload/Delete access to everyone create potential security vulnerabilities by allowing anyone to add, modify, or remove items in a bucket.
   This check examines explicit bucket permissions and associated bucket policies that might override the bucket permissions.

3- MFA on Root Account.
   Checks the root account and warns if multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not enabled.
   For increased security, AWS recommends that you protect your account by using MFA, which requires a user to enter a unique authentication code from their MFA hardware or virtual device when interacting with the AWS console and associated websites.


You can configure Trusted Advisor notifications to receive weekly email about any changes in their check results.
You can also subscribe to Business and Enterprise-level support to access the full suite of Trusted Advisor best-practice checks, API access, and a host of other support features, such as phone and chat access to support personnel, architecture guidance, API access, and help with third-party software configuration.

AWS Trusted Advisor draws upon best practices learned from serving hundreds of thousands of AWS customers.
Trusted Advisor inspects your AWS environment, and then makes recommendations when opportunities exist to save money, improve system availability and performance, or help close security gaps.
All AWS customers have access to five Trusted Advisor checks.
Customers with a Business or Enterprise support plan can view all Trusted Advisor checks.

AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides you real time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices.
Trusted Advisor checks help optimize your AWS infrastructure, increase security and performance, reduce your overall costs, and monitor service limits.
Whether establishing new workflows, developing applications, or as part of ongoing improvement, take advantage of the recommendations provided by Trusted Advisor on a regular basis to help keep your solutions provisioned optimally.

AWS Basic Support and AWS Developer Support customers get access to 6 security checks (S3 Bucket Permissions, Security Groups - Specific Ports Unrestricted, IAM Use, MFA on Root Account, EBS Public Snapshots, RDS Public Snapshots) and 50 service limit checks.
AWS Business Support and AWS Enterprise Support customers get access to all 115 Trusted Advisor checks (14 cost optimization, 17 security, 24 fault tolerance, 10 performance, and 50 service limits) and recommendations.

Organizational view for AWS Trusted Advisor :
Organizational view lets you view Trusted Advisor checks for all accounts in your AWS Organizations.
After you enable this feature, you can create reports to aggregate the check results for all member accounts in your organization.
The report includes a summary of check results and information about affected resources for each account.
The management account in your organization must have a Business or Enterprise support plan TO use this.
